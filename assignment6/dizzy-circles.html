                    Array(s) that will hold our shapes x and y coordinates. Can be done with

                With one array...
                shapes[0] is the x coordinate for the first shape and
                shapes[1] is the y coordinate for the first shape and so on...

                x and y coordinates on the canvas.

                for each shape in our shapes arrays. These are the values that will be
                added to the shapes coordinates each time the shapes are moved.
                If it is a positive value the x or y coordinate will be increased
                so the shape will move right/down. If it is a negative value adding

                shapeYSpeed[0] is the y speed for the first shape
